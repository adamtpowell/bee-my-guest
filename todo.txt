* Update test harness to directly launch the server code instead of using bash to do so.
* Change the * listener on connections to be explicitly different.
    * Maybe they can subscribe to a bus?
    * Or they generally have a function which pub subs?
        * That's kinda what they already are lol
* encapsulate server in a class.
    * it will have a close method which changes a variable saying to cancel the event loop
    * that should let me wrap the server in a way that lets me cancel it.
    * Also moves complexity out of main.ts
* Find where to logically put receiveSocket and what to call it.
